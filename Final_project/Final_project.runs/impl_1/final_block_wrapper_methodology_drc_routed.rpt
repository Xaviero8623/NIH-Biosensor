TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.368 ns between final_block_i/Top_level_0/U0/cycle_3/current_sin_value_reg[4]/C (clocked by clk_42MHz_final_block_clk_wiz_0_0) and final_block_i/Top_level_0/U0/threshold_output_3_reg[4]/D (clocked by clk_40MHz_final_block_clk_wiz_0_0).
